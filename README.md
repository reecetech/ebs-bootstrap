# ebs-bootstrap

![Screenshot of Configuration File and Output](assets/ebs-bootstrap.png)

`ebs-bootstrap` is a tool that provides a **safe** and **as-code** approach for managing block devices on AWS EC2. It supports the following block device operations...

* **Format** a file system
* **Label** a file system
* **Resize** a file system (when a threshold is reached)
* **Mount** a block device
* **Ownership** and **Permissions** management of the mount point

Currently, the following file systems are supported for querying and modification...

* `ext4`
* `xfs`

Block device mappings can be [unpredictable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html#device-name-limits) for AWS Nitro EC2 Instance types. `ebs-bootstrap` is equipped with the tools to recover the originally assigned block device mappings (`/dev/sd[a-z]`) from the dynamically allocated device names (`/dev/nvme[0-26]n1`) produced by **EBS** and **Instance Store** volumes. The consistent as-code management of block devices, is only possible by the ability of `ebs-bootstrap` to recover a device name that is stable across reboots and instance refreshes.

## Build

`ebs-bootstrap` is a **statically-compiled** binary that can be built for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. This process is facilitated by a multi-architecture Docker build process.

```bash
# Specific Architecture
[~] ./build/docker.sh --architecture arm64
[~] ls -la
ebs-bootstrap-linux-aarch64

# All Architectures
[~] ./build/docker.sh
[~] ls -la
ebs-bootstrap-linux-aarch64
ebs-bootstrap-linux-x86_64
```

## Installation

The latest binary of `ebs-bootstrap` can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/reecetech/ebs-bootstrap/releases)

```
curl -L \
  -o /tmp/ebs-bootstrap \
  "https://github.com/reecetech/ebs-bootstrap/releases/latest/download/ebs-bootstrap-linux-$(uname -m)"
sudo install -m755 /tmp/ebs-bootstrap /usr/local/sbin/ebs-bootstrap
```

## Use Cases

### `systemd`

A potential way of operating `ebs-bootstrap` is through a `systemd` service. This is so we can configure it as a `oneshot` service type that executes after the file system is ready and after `clout-init.service` writes any config files to disk. The latter is essential as `ebs-bootstrap` consumes a config file that is located at `/etc/ebs-boostrap/config.yml` by default. 

`ExecStopPost=-...` con point towards a script that is executed when the `ebs-bootstrap` service exits on either success or failure. This is a suitable place to include logic to notify an individual that the configured devices failed their relevant healthchecks and the underlying application failed to launch in the process.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=EBS Bootstrap
After=local-fs.target cloud-init.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=true
StandardInput=null
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/ebs-bootstrap
PrivateMounts=no
MountFlags=shared
ExecStopPost=-/etc/ebs-bootstrap/post-hook.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```
cat /etc/ebs-bootstrap/post-hook.sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ "${EXIT_STATUS}" = "0" ]; then
    echo "üü¢ Post Stop Hook: Success"
else
    echo "üî¥ Post Stop Hook: Failure"
fi
```

It is then possible to configure another `systemd` service to only start if the `ebs-bootstrap` service is successful. Certain databases support the ability to spread database chunks across multiple devices that need to be mounted to pre-defined directories with the correct ownership and permissions. In this particular use-case, the database could be configured as a `systemd` service that relies on the `ebs-bootstrap.service` to succeed before attempting to start. This can be achieved by specifiying `ebs-boostrap.service` as a dependency in the `Requires=` and `After=` parameters.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Example Database
Wants=network-online.target
Requires=ebs-bootstrap.service
After=network.target network-online.target ebs-bootstrap.service

[Service]
Type=forking
User=ec2-user
Group=ec2-user
ExecStart=/usr/bin/database start
ExecStop=/usr/bin/database stop

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### `cloud-init`

By default, `ebs-bootstrap` consumes a configuration file located at `/etc/ebs-boostrap/config.yml`. `cloud-init` can be configured to write a config to this location, using the `write_files` module. Ensure that `ebs-bootstrap` is installed on your Instance via the process of baking it into your Golden AMI or downloading it early in the boot process, using the `runcmd` module.

The advent of Instance Store provided Nitro-enabled EC2 instances the ability to harness the power of high speed NVMe. For a stateful workload like a database, you might want a fast and ephemeral space for temporary tables, alongside a stateful EBS volume declared in a different CloudFormation Stack. However, these Instance Store devices were ephemeral and had to be formatted and mounted on each startup cycle. 

From the perspective of a **sceptical** Platforms Engineer, you do not mind a tool like `ebs-bootstrap` automating the task of formatting and mounting an ephemeral device. However, you personally draw the line on automation executing modifications to a stateful device, **without** the prior consent of a human. `ebs-bootstrap` empowers this Platform Engineer by allowing them to specify the execution mode, on a **device-by-device** basis: Instance Store (`force`) and EBS Volume (`healthcheck`)

```yaml
Resources:
  Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
  ...
  InstanceType: m5ad.large  # Nitro Instance Type
  Volumes:
    - Device: /dev/sdb  # EBS Volume (Stateful)
      VolumeId: !ImportValue EbsVolumeId
  BlockDeviceMappings:
    - DeviceName: /dev/sdh  # Instance Store (Ephemeral)
      VirtualName: ephemeral0
  UserData:
    Fn::Base64: !Sub
      - |+
        #cloud-config
        write_files:
          - content: |
              devices:
                /dev/sdb:
                  fs: ${FileSystem}
                  mountPoint: /mnt/ebs
                  mountOptions: ${MountOptions}
                  user: ec2-user
                  group: ec2-user
                  permissions: 755
                  label: stateful
                  mode: healthcheck
                /dev/sdh:
                  fs: ${FileSystem}
                  mountPoint: /mnt/instance-store
                  mountOptions: ${MountOptions}
                  user: ec2-user
                  group: ec2-user
                  permissions: 755
                  label: ephemeral
                  mode: force
            path: /etc/ebs-bootstrap/config.yml
        runcmd:
          - curl -L -o /tmp/ebs-bootstrap "${EbsBootstrapUrlPrefix}-$(uname -m)"
          - install -m755 /tmp/ebs-bootstrap /usr/local/sbin/ebs-bootstrap
        bootcmd:
          - /usr/local/sbin/ebs-bootstrap
      - FileSystem: ext4
        MountOptions: defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=5
        EbsBootstrapUrlPrefix: >
          https://github.com/reecetech/ebs-bootstrap/releases/download/latest/ebs-bootstrap-linux
```

Assuming this is the very first launch, `ebs-bootstrap` would refuse to perform any modifications associated to the EBS device as it was assigned the `healthcheck` mode. However, we can temporarily override this behaviour with the `-mode=prompt` option. This allows the Platform Engineer to approve any suggested changes by `ebs-bootstrap`.

```
[~] sudo /usr/local/sbin/ebs-bootstrap -mode=prompt
üîµ /dev/nvme1n1: Detected Nitro-based AWS NVMe device => /dev/sdb
üîµ /dev/nvme2n1: Detected Nitro-based AWS NVMe device => /dev/sdh
üü† Formatting larger disks can take several seconds ‚åõ
üü£ Would you like to format /dev/nvme1n1 to ext4? (y/n): y
‚≠ê Successfully formatted /dev/nvme1n1 to ext4
üü† Certain file systems require that devices be unmounted prior to labeling
üü£ Would you like to label device /dev/nvme1n1 to 'stateful'? (y/n): y
‚≠ê Successfully labelled /dev/nvme1n1 to 'stateful'
...
üü£ Would you like to change ownership (1000:1000) of /mnt/ebs? (y/n): y
‚≠ê Successfully changed ownership (1000:1000) of /mnt/ebs
üü¢ Passed all validation checks
```

By inspecting the output of `lsblk`, we can verify that `ebs-bootstrap` was able to recover the CloudFormation assigned block device mappings (`/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdh`) from both EBS and Instance Store NVMe devices (`/dev/nvme1n1` and `/dev/nvme2n1`) and format/label/mount the respective devices
```
[~] lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL,SIZE

The `mounts` module of `cloud-init` will create an entry in `/etc/fstab` for the EBS volume. The EBS volume, now labelled `stateful`, will be mounted to `/mnt/ebs` on **future reboots**. Despite device names being unstable because of the dynamical allocation behaviour of the Nitro NVMe driver, their respective labels remain stable across reboots.
```
[~] cat /etc/fstab
LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs	/	 ext4	defaults,discard	0 1
LABEL=UEFI	/boot/efi	vfat	umask=0077	0 1
LABEL=stateful	/mnt/ebs	ext4	defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=5,comment=cloudconfig	0	2
```
